# Discriminative

This category is named as `Disciminative` for the publications listed do the same thing with the previous Deep Learning Recommendation System (DLRM): 
predict score for items, instead of generating an item. 

They basically re-construct model architecture using `Transformers`, leading to the name of `Generative`.
